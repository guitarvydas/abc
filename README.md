# Ultra-simple language compiler
- define grammar for ABC language
- generate (actually "transpile", to be accurate) the test example source code to Python, to Javascript, to Lisp, to an Intermediate Representation, then, again to Python and to Javascript
- transpilation happens in several stages
  1. parse
  2. rewrite
  3. [run the resulting transpiled code using the host language (Python, Javascript, Lisp ; skip this step in this simple example - see abc2py for an example of running code)]

This code generator uses `pbp/t2t.bash` raw in _text_ form without using diagrams. (See the See Also section below).

# Usage
`$ make`

## Output
The output should be:
```
Identity

b<-2
c<-3
a<-b+c 

Javascript

let b = 2; 
let c = 3; 
let a = b + c ; 

Lisp

(let ((b 2)) 
(let ((c 3)) 
(let ((a (+ b c) )) )))

Python

b = 2
c = 3
a = b + c 

IR (Intermediate Representation)

(let ((b 2)) 
(let ((c 3)) 
(let ((a (+ b c) )) )))

Javascript from IR (test.abcir)

let b = 2;
let c = 3;
let a = b + c;

Python from IR (test.abcir)

b = 2
c = 3
a = b + c
```

## What does that output mean?
The source file is `test.abc`. This example code is just 3 lines of code, to keep things simple.
`Identity` - input source file, output the same unaltered except for removal of some spaces ; an easy workflow is to build the grammar using [Ohm editor](https://ohmjs.org/editor/), save the grammar out to a `.ohm` file, create a dummy identity `.rwr` file and test that the combination of `.ohm` and `.rwr` works. After that, hack on the `.rwr` file to make it generate the desired result.
`Javascript` - `test.abc` written out in Javascript format
`Lisp` - `test.abc` written out in Lisp format
`Python` - `test.abc` written out in Python format
`IR (Intermediate Representation)` - `test.abc` written out in Internal Representation format (the I.R. looks like Lisp)
	- this becomes the "new" source file for the transpilations below
	- the new source is written to `test.abcir` (feel free to look at that file)
`Javascript from IR (test.abcir)` - `test.abcir` written out in Python format (again, but using the IR this time)
`Python from IR (test.abcir)` - `test.abcir` written out in Python format (again, but using the IR this time)

The output lines of code do nothing useful. The best you can do is to look at them to see if they look right.

See project `arith` for a diagrammatic version of a compiler which allows a programmer to build code generators using LEGOÂ®-like black boxes. 

[aside: PBP drawware can be used to build other kinds of things, beyond just code generators, but these examples `abc`, `abc2py`, `arith` show only one use of PBP - that of building code generators].
